Jenkins Scripts
===============

This repository contains scripts to install and drive web-validation tools for
use with Jenkins (or, if you want to tweak them, other CI systems). These
include:

- Scripts to "refresh" web-sites based on SPIP and Drupal within a CI system.
  These make certain assumptions about repository layout, database usage, and
  the like.

- Scripts to install the W3C HTML validator and validator.nu HTML5 validators.
  These assume that they are run on a Debian-based distribution and use
  dependencies from packages where possible.

- A script to mirror a web-site (one maintained by a job using the scripts
  mentioned above, for example) and pump it through an instance of the W3C
  validator (as installed by the scripts mentioned above).

To make best use of them, you might like run them like so:

1. Install the W3C HTML validator with `validators/install-w3c-validator.sh`.

2. Add Checkstyle XML support to it with
   `validators/install-w3c-validator-checkstyle.sh`.

3. Install the HTML5 validator with `validators/install-html5-validator.sh`.

4. Configure Apache to serve the workspaces of Jenkins jobs. A configuration
   like `apache/job-workspaces.conf` might help.

4. Setup web-site jobs using `bin/update-drupal.sh`, `bin/update-magento.sh`,
   `bin/update-spip.sh`.

5. Setup validation jobs to execute `bin/validate.sh` and then check the
   resulting reports.

There is a *lot* more that could be done here, but this is something of a
start.
